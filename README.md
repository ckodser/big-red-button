## Big Red Button _in JavaScript_

<table><tr><td>
  <a href="https://jklewa.github.io/big-red-button/">
    <img border="1" width="400" height="266" src="https://jklewa.github.io/big-red-button/screenshot.png" alt="Try it yourself">
  </a>
</td></tr></table>

This script was converted by hand from flash to javascript.

No, I did not have access to the original flash source code. I went through every frame of the BigRedButton.swf
the same way everyone else did and copied everything over as accurately as I could.

Anyway, have fun and try not to [spoil it](index.html) for yourself by reading my source code.
